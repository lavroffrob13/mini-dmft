# mini-dmft
Solves the 1-D Hubbard model in DFT+DMFT style, starting from a tight-binding model and turning on U (Hubbard-I approximation to the impurity solver, which assumes the atomic limit).

Coming:
- Other simple impurity solvers like Hartree Fock and 2nd order perturbation theory
- Fillings other than half
- Finite temperature
- Bethe ansatze comparisons
- 2-D and 3-D lattices
